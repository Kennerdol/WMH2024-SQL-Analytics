# Wusakile-Hospital-2024-SQL-Analytics
## SQL project for Wusakile Hospital 2024 data analysis and reporting

Wusakile Hospital 2024 SQL Analytics is a data-driven project designed to analyze hospital operations, patient records, and medical services using SQL. The project includes an Excel dataset (wusakileHospital2024.xlsx) containing raw hospital data and a SQL script (wusakilehospital.sql) for database creation and data analysis.

## Why This Project?
Healthcare institutions generate vast amounts of data daily, but without proper analysis, critical insights may be overlooked. This project leverages SQL analytics to provide actionable insights that enhance patient care, optimize hospital administration, and improve financial management.

## Key Features
- SQL Queries – Advanced queries for retrieving, filtering, and summarizing hospital data.
- Patient Data Analysis – Insights into patient demographics, visit patterns, and common diagnoses.
- Performance Metrics – Evaluation of doctor workloads and hospital efficiency.

## Objectives
- Structure hospital data into a relational database.
- Analyze patient records, medical procedures, and hospital efficiency.
- Generate insights using SQL queries for better decision-making.

##Project Files
